# Adam Kovacevich's Portfolio
## Description
This is my professional portfolio. Please take your time to learn more about me and my coding experience.

 I created this portfolio for my future employer(s) to reference during the interview process. I have built and continue to maintain this project so that I stay competitive in the job marketplace. 
 
 Furthermore, I like to utilize this project to track some of my favorite projects and ensure that I am always coding. 
 
 My goal is to flood this portfolio site with every project I complete.


Please feel free to leave me feedback and contact me if you have any questions.
